# Rusty Design Patterns

Hey there! Welcome to my personal playground for learning Rust and diving into design patterns. This repository is where I'm experimenting with Rust while exploring various design patterns. It's a journey of self-improvement, and I'm happy to share it with you.

## What's Going On

### Builder Design Pattern

**Project Folder**: `builder`

**My Notes**: In this project, I'm creating a product with different attributes, one at a time.

### Facade Design Pattern

**Project Folder**: `facade`

**My Notes**: The project showcases a car starting system simplified with a facade.

### Factory Design Pattern

**Project Folder** `factory`

**My Notes**: This uses the example of shapes to make a factory. The shapes are constructed seperately and then the ShapeFactory builds them when they are needed.

### Singleton Design Pattern

**Project Folder**: `singleton`

**My Notes**: This project is all about the Singleton pattern. I'm trying to understand how it works in Rust by creating a Singleton configuration that can be accessed and modified from different parts of the code.

### Strategy Design Pattern

**Project Folder**: `strategy`

**My Notes**: The Strategy pattern offers the flexibility to switch algorithms at runtime. In this shopping cart example, I'm learning how to choose payment strategies dynamically.
